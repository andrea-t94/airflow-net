Done
- dag miner
- instruction creator using Claude with multithreading 


To do
- evaluator on top of ast compiler (airflow dag compiler?) and discard the non good ones to finalise dataset
- create an mcp that enable semantic search on the whole airflow github, based on version



Next steps
- LLM as teacher that generate new type of instructions (debugging)
- generalise api calls to any LLM 
- add a way to score code complexity (euristic) and analyse performances for different complexity and version
- inject known failures (based on my experience and on mosto common I find in source code) into current correct DAGs implementations dataset for creating a troubleshooting dataset for finetuning


Dag miner overview
- it mines github official repo since it has lots of example for all the versions
- check python file correctness with ast and compile
- out of scope airflow compiler or unit test(too complicated, it has to be worth it)
- it (only) checks if there are internal import with simle euristics
- it adds metadata for analyse SML performance later on
